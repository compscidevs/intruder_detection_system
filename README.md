# Intrusion Detection System

## Overview

This project focuses on enhancing home security by developing an advanced intruder detection system. It uses a combination of motion detection, image recognition, and immediate alert mechanisms to provide real-time notifications of unauthorized entries.

## Key Features

- **Motion Detection:** PIR sensor triggers the camera to capture images.
- **Image Recognition:** Compares captured images with a database of authorized personnel.
- **Immediate Alerts:** Sends email alerts with intruder photos and initiates automated phone calls via GSM.

## Components

- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 4, PIR Motion Sensor, Camera Module, GSM Module, Battery
- **Software:** Machine learning model for image recognition, Python for system integration

## How It Works

1. **Detection:** Motion is detected by the PIR sensor.
2. **Capture:** Camera takes images of the detected motion.
3. **Analysis:** Images are analyzed against the database using machine learning.
4. **Alert:** If an intruder is detected, email and phone call alerts are sent.
